# ** AboutMe **

## My name is Madison Winzeler, I am 32 years old and live in Tampa, FL.  I lived most of my life in Reno, NV and Tokyo, Japan.
## I graduated in May of 2011 with a BS in Business Administration and Information Systems.  I am currently enrolled in MS of Cybersecurity and the University of Tampa with an expected graduation date of Spring 2020.
## I started off my career in 2008-2017 in logistics and transportation working with FedEx, Con-Way Freight, Hamilton Robotics, and Tesla.  During that time, I was also a Soldier in the Nevada Army National Guard as a Communications Officer.  In 2017, I decided to make a career change and fully embrace the IT side of my life and went to an 8-month long school with the Army in Augusta, GA and have been working full-time since October 2017.  I have seen the importance of Cybersecurity within the DoD and wanted to gain a better understanding so that I could continue to be relevant and also make myself marketable in the Civilian sector.
### Currently I am in charge of our current Enterprise IT Infrastructure for over 1000 personnel, that supports tactical real-world missions across the globe.  I have been able to gain an immense amount of experience in a short time and look forward to doing so for the foreseable future.
